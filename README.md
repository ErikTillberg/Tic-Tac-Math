A fascinating story of a bunch of numbers in a grid who attempt to come together to form the number 15. 

# Game Rules

* Highlight the text field (where the dashes are) and input a number between 1 and 9
* The CPU then takes a turn
* If either you or the CPU reaches 15 in a column/row/diagonal, then there is a winner.
* The winner is the LAST PERSON to input a number if 15 is reached (you don't have to input all 3 numbers to win, 2 of them could be the CPU's).
